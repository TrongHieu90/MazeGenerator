### Translation of p5/javascript code from the [CodingTrain](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) channel into Windows Form with C#

**[Exercise Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS0jfmyKfjs)**

The main algorithm is inside the [Form1.cs](https://github.com/TrongHieu90/MazeSolver/blob/master/MazeGeneration/MazeGeneration/Form1.cs) file. There are some modifications to make it work inside Windows Form (which makes you appreciate the p5 library even more with how it simplifies things)

Combining [Maze Generator](https://github.com/TrongHieu90/MazeGenerator) and [Pathfinding A*](https://github.com/TrongHieu90/PathfindingAStar) to create to Maze Solver that will find the most efficient path through a random maze.
